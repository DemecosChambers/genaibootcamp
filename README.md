## Functional Requirements 

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure to ensure 
the reason is their consern about privacy of user data and the on-going cost of GENAI raising in cost.
They want to invest in a AI PC, where they can afford to spend $10-#30k
they have 300 active students, and students are located within the region of Cartegena, Colombia. 

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the open source LLMs we chose, will be powerful enough to run within hardware with an investment of $10k - $15k 

We are just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet. We should have enough bandwith to server the 300 students. 

## Data Strategy 

There is a concern of copywritten material. We must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.
